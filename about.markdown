Hello my name is Lawann, and welcome to my GitHub website 😄. I was born and raised on the island of Saint Lucia which is home to the Twin Peaks aka The Pitons, as seen in the photo above. 


Currently, I serve as the Finance Associate at Elizabeth Consulting International Inc. <img src="/img/company_logo_.ico">, where I working closely with the Finance Manager, Mingee Lucien

I love cooking and expirementing with various cultures cuisines and incorporating them in my own recipes. I aspire to write a cook book in the near future 👩🏽‍🍳. I also enjoy watching cricket whether it be international matches or league matches. Though I love the game, I am not a good player 😅.
